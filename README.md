# Sprite Animation in Java

This is a simple Java project demonstrating **sprite-based animation** using `AWT`, `Swing`, and a custom-built `ScreenManager`. A small animated character (sprite) bounces around the screen using velocity and time-based updates â€” mimicking a basic game loop.

### Technologies Used

- Java SE (AWT, Swing)
- Custom `Animation` and `Sprite` classes
- Full-screen graphics with `ScreenManager`
- Image rendering with `ImageIcon`
- Thread-based timing for frame control

---

###  Project Structure

- `Sprite.java`: Defines a game sprite with position, velocity, and animation handling
- `Hamid2.java`: Main class that runs the application, handles screen setup, image loading, and the game loop
- `Animation.java` and `ScreenManager.java`: (Assumed helper classes used for frame control and screen resolution management)
